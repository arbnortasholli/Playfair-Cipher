Playfair Cipher - Java Implementation with GUI

This project is a Java-based implementation of the Playfair Cipher, a classical encryption technique, with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction. The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts text based on a 5x5 matrix of letters.

What is the Playfair Cipher?

The Playfair Cipher, invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854, is one of the earliest encryption algorithms. It encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs) rather than single letters, which makes it harder to break than traditional ciphers. The cipher uses a 5x5 matrix constructed from a keyword and applies a set of rules for encryption and decryption.
